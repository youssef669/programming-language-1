        <p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine
            code output.
            Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement
            algorithms.
            Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a
            set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages.

        <p>Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG, Oracle
            Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP, and Dell have spent more than $15 billion on software firms
            specializing in data management and analytics.
            In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100 billion and was growing at almost 10 percent a year: about
            twice as fast as the software business as a whole.</p>

        Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and
        implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the
        implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their
        intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal
        scripting languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor,
        while others are available to external users.

        Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, Oracle Corporation
        asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language,[61] and Microsoft's C# programming
        language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has Common Language Runtime (CLR) as
        a closed environment.[62]

        Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include MATLAB,
        VBScript, and Wolfram Language. Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, Erlang
        was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language
